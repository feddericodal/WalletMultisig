create a fullstack application with solidity,hardhat,react,rainbowkit


This was my second fullstack project that I completed and I hadn't realized yet that there were also other functions in wagmi that I could use, however everything works perfectly. if you want to get it going:

1) npx hardhat node --> start hardhat network
2) npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost --> deploy contract on network
3)npm start --> start react and the proje
